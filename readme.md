#MOD4 Express Pre-Work

I did the following extended challenges:

- Add a client-side JavaScript file with some interactivity. It's a button. That changes the background color. Amazing!

- Create some JSON data in a separate file, load that file in the server, and send it to requests made to /json. It's my name, but FANCY.

- Add a 404 response. It's snarky Tolkein reference. You're welcome, nerds.
